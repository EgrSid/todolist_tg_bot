## Features

### 1. **Task Management**
The bot allows users to create, view, and manage their to-do lists efficiently. Tasks can be categorized into three different types, expanding the range of possibilities for note-taking and task management:

### 2. **Priority Levels**
Users can assign priority levels to their notes, marking them as high, medium, or low importance. When retrieving notes, the bot sorts them automatically, displaying higher-priority notes first. This feature ensures that critical tasks and reminders are always at the top of the list, making it easier to focus on what’s most important.

### 3. **Versatile Functionality**
The bot’s ability to handle different types of notes (text, photos, and documents) makes it a powerful tool for a wide variety of use cases, such as:
- **Personal Task Management**: Keep track of daily tasks, reminders, and important notes.
